## Problem History

I originally saw this problem presented by Ben Sparks on Numberphile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkVe8qrT0LA. 

This problems seems to have been around before hand though as I found it on New Scientist https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24232361-100-puzzle-09-the-cake-and-the-candles/
